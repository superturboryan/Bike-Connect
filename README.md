Bike Connect turns your Di2 bike’s handlebar buttons into controls for your iPhone, Apple Watch, and Mac. Control music and volume, view gear/battery/firmware, use your flashlight as a headlight, ring a virtual bell, and even trigger keyboard shortcuts to control any app (such as **Zwift**) on Mac.

## Features
+ Full music control — play, pause, and skip in Apple Music, Spotify, and more
+ Volume at your fingertips — raise/lower volume or mute instantly
+ Bike data — view gear selection, battery level, and firmware version
+ Use your flashlight as a headlight — toggle on/off or quick flash (**iOS + Android only**)
+ Ring a virtual bell — play a bell sound even on the lock screen (**iOS + Android only**)
+ Keyboard shortcuts for (virtual cycling) apps (**macOS only**)
+ Apple Watch app — turn your watch into a gear indicator (**watchOS**)

## What’s New (iOS + macOS 1.2.0)
A big 1.2.0 for Bike Connect! Revamped with Apple’s new Liquid Glass design and a standalone Apple Watch app.
- New: Independent watchOS app — connect to your BLE bike, see your current gears, and ring a bell from shifter top buttons (no phone needed)
- New: Cowbell sound to celebrate this release. More cowbell!
- Improved: Liquid Glass look throughout iOS, iPadOS & watchOS
- Improved: Gear display on watch — larger, clearer type
- Fixed: General polish and performance improvements

> [!TIP]
> If you're running into issues with using the watchOS app, try updating your device to watchOS 26.
